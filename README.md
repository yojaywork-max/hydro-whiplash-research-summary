# hydro-whiplash-research-summary
A summary of my study on hydrological whiplashes.
Whiplash, a newly coined term by climate scientist to refer to the quick transition from one extreme to the other. This project focuses on hydrological whiplash, which in this case we are looking at quick Dry-to-Wet or Wet-to-Dry event. We learn from the method of the paper: [Increasing global precipitation whiplash due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions(Tan et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38510-9)

The document is aim to summarize how whiplash is calculated based on Tan's framework, and some revision that we propose for further study.
